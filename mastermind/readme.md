<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Mastermind app is a web-based implementation of the classic code-breaking game where players attempt to crack a randomly generated number combination, known as the master code. After each guess, the computer provides helpful feedback indicating how many numbers are correct and how many are in the exact right position. Players have 10 attempts to guess the correct combination and win the game.

The application features single-player gameplay against the computer with multiple difficulty levels to choose from. Additionally, it includes leaderboard functionality that tracks and displays the players with the most wins at each difficulty level.
