<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The Mastermind app is a web-based implementation of the classic code-breaking game where players attempt to crack a randomly generated number combination, known as the master code. After each guess, the computer provides helpful feedback indicating how many numbers are correct and how many are in the exact right position. Players have 10 attempts to guess the correct combination and win the game.

The application features single-player gameplay against the computer with multiple difficulty levels to choose from. Additionally, it includes leaderboard functionality that tracks and displays the players with the most wins at each difficulty level.

This project focuses on building robust backend infrastructure for a Mastermind game, providing a well-structured API that enables frontend engineers to easily integrate and build user interfaces on top of it. The codebase emphasizes readability and modularity, making it straightforward to debug and extend with additional features. By prioritizing maintainability, the architecture allows new developers to contribute effectively with minimal onboarding time. Beyond the core game mechanics, a competitive scoreboard tracks user wins by difficulty level, adding an engaging element to the classic gameplay. The project also includes a comprehensive API specification that documents all available endpoints for easy integration

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Create a player
* Enter username then click "Continue"

Create Game Room
* Enter a room name and select difficulty then click "Create Room"

Game Play
* Click "Start Game"
* Submit a 4-6 digit number (depending on the difficulty), digits must be 0-7
* Once your guess has been submitted your guess and feedback will populate onto the screen
* The game is completed once you have guessed the master code or you have run out of guesses
* Once the game is completed you can restart the game with a new master code by clicking "Reset Game"
* You can navigate back to the Room Creation page by clicking "Back to Room Creation"
